# Population Mean
## Symbol
The **population mean** symbol is `μ`.

## Definition
The **population mean** is an **average** of a group characteristic.  

> For example:  
> - In a school of `1,013` students, the **average** GPA is `3.1`.
> - Dogs seen in a certain veterinary practice weigh, on **average**, `38` pounds.
> - Books in one school’s public library are checked out `7` times per year, on **average**.

In **statistics**, it’s actually rare that you can calculate the **population mean**.  
That’s because asking an **entire population** about something is usually cost prohibitive or too time consuming.
